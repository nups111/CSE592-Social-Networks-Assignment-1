1. li_data.csv : raw data consisting of the adjacency matrix
2. li_data_ties.csv: Manually drawn tie strength for each friend.
3. li_data_communities.csv : Manually labelled communities based on the location at which the contact was known. : 1. Stony Brook University 2. VJTI 3. SVIS
Also there are a few outliers.
This file is considered as the ground truth data to be compared with the generated spectral clustering graph 

4. Ego Network.png : Graph of ego network
5. Spectral Network.png: Scatter plot of spectral clustering for all the points
6. Spectral Graph.png: Convergence of all points using spectral clustering.

The spectral clustering graph (Spectral Network.png) shows three clusters thus matching th ground truth data. However it does not significantly show the outliers.
